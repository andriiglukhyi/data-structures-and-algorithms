# Quicksort
Write a function that accepts an array of positive integers, and returns an array sorted by a radix sort algorithm.

## Challenge
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Solution
