# Find all matches
Write a function that takes a k-ary tree with non-unique values and a target value.
Return a collection of all the nodes from within the tree that match the provided value.
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.
## Challenge
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
